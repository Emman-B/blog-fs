# Blog Full-Stack Web App

This is a full-stack blogging web application that will support creating, publishing, and reading blog posts. These blog posts will support rich-text or some variant of it.

At the moment, I do not have plans to officially deploy this project in a production environment. The current plan is to have the application available to host locally.

## Disclaimer
The structure based off a university assignment that uses the same stack in the creation of a full stack web application. The similarities to this assignment are mainly related to the project structure and not the actual code itself.
