# Blog Full-Stack Web App

This is a full-stack blogging web application that will support creating, publishing, and reading blog posts. These blog posts will support rich-text or some variant of it.

At the moment, I do not have plans to officially deploy this project in a production environment. The current plan is to have the application available to host locally.

## Disclaimer
The structure based off a university assignment that uses the same stack in the creation of a full stack web application. There may be similarities in this project to **my own implementation** of said assignment, but most (if not all) of the similarities are related to project structure and other required setup.
